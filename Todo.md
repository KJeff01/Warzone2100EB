General:
- [low] Add updated stats to the non-NullBot family of AIs.
- [medium] Check all muzzle effects for ALL non-vanilla weapons...

Campaign:
- [low] Test campaign and see if it can be beaten on Insane difficulty (likely tone down Ultscav enemy production rates).
- [medium] Merge camBalance script updates when it is finally finished.
- [high] campaign map updates that are needed: https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/commit/8b9a32690d7a0e1e44f0d0de9709b2d6101f6bd9#diff-9c41e03aacc85622c1cdeffb8e593b0201f090888de4f4ea618ed4b511de0b2d

Or start all over for campaign and base it off 4.2.0.

Warzone:
- [medium] Super tall structures block visibility in build menus.
- [critical] ECM/jammer is a problem again since they are packed with the mod.
