The Enhanced Balance mod uses textures, models, effects, and shaders from a few other projects.

In order to keep using the original parent project's art assets (reserved for "weaker" or low-end technologies in this mod), some assets belonging to these
projects are located within the folder "mix" under modified yet similar filenames in their respective folders.

### Updating the mod
Copy all the contents of these folders into the main mod, EB-Mod.wz. Always copy folder "override" as the final step since it may
contain bugfixes from the master branch of the parent project.
